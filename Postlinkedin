🚗 Excited to share my latest #DataScience project: Smart Parking Prediction Dashboard! 🚘

I've developed a comprehensive machine learning solution that helps parking operators optimize their operations and enhance user experience through predictive analytics:

🔍 Key Features:
• Parking duration prediction using regression models
• Real-time occupancy forecasting with enhanced classification algorithms
• User behavior clustering that segments customers into meaningful profiles
• API-powered backend with Flask for seamless integration

💡 Business Impact:
• Optimize parking space allocation based on predicted occupancy
• Personalize pricing strategies for different user segments
• Improve traffic flow management during peak hours
• Data-driven decision making for facility planning

The system employs multiple ML models (regression, classification, and K-means clustering) with standardized preprocessing pipelines to ensure accurate predictions across different scenarios.
